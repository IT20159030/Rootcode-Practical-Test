**How to Run in Development**

This repository contains both the frontend and backend components of the application. Follow the instructions below to run the project in development mode.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React with Vite as the bundler. To run the frontend in development mode, navigate to the 'frontend' folder using the command line and follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the 'frontend' folder:**
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Before running the development server, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start the development server, and you can access the frontend of the application by opening your browser and navigating to the provided development URL.

## Backend

The backend of the application is managed separately. To run the backend in development mode, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the 'backend' folder:**
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Similar to the frontend, you need to install the backend dependencies. Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the backend server using the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the backend server, allowing it to handle requests from the frontend.

Remember to keep both the frontend and backend servers running simultaneously in development mode for the application to function correctly.

Now you're all set to develop and test the application in a local development environment. Make sure to consult the documentation or README for any additional information or troubleshooting steps.
